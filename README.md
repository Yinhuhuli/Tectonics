Figure S1 shows the process of the displacement measurement method. Figure S2 presents all topographic profiles. Figure S3 and S4 give the raw images to facilitate readers to identify the fault trace. Figure S5 gives the calculation results of the cumulative offset probability density based on the horizontal displacements along the S2 and S3 segments. Table S1 displays all horizontal displacement measurements along the Chenghai Fault. Table S2 shows the magnitude estimate of the Yongsheng earthquake in 1515 based on empirical formulas. Table S3 presents the slip rate of active faults in the Sichuan-Yunnan block revealed by the geodesy. Table S4 presents late Quaternary horizontal slip rate of active faults in the Sichuan-Yunnan block. Data Set S1 includes a kmz file of the mapped fault trace
